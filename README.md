# Rock Paper Scissors game using Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
The program using uses Computer Vision to detect the user's move and plays the counter to the most probable move. 


-------
### The Project entails two use cases of AI:
1. We use Computer Vision to identify the move played by the human, and
2. This game can read the players' patterns and determines the counter to the most probable move the player can make, and hence the 'AI' makes the move, in order to win the game.
